There are a few things that you need to do in order to get the web
interface working correctly.

First, the directories and files need to have the correct permissions:

	chmod 666 $GALAXYNGHOME/data/next_turn
	chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/data
	chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/forecasts
	chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/orders
	chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/reports
	chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/statistics

You need to change the path to your galaxyng directory in index.html.
For example:
	/home/user/Games

You might need to change the name of index.html to index.php.
