There are a few things that you need to do in order to get the web
interface working correctly.

First, the directories and files need to have the correct permissions:

chmod 666 $GALAXYNGHOME/data/next_turn
chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/data
chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/forecasts
chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/orders
chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/reports
chmod a+w $GALAXYNGHOME/statistics


in process_orders.php you need to change the @SETHOME@ to the path to
your galaxyng installation directory. For example, on my test server I
would change @SETHOME@ to /home/gng/Games
