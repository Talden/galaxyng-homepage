<!-- you can customize this, and it will not be overwritten when you upgrade.
     what normally goes in here is the contents of the <head></head> portion
     of the HTML file. So you can, for example, put in CSS links and such, a
     title for your page, etc.  Just prior to this you have the <html> tag
     and following this will be either the <form> tag or a <p> tag with the
     contents of the report or the forecast. -->
